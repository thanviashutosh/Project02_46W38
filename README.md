Discussion and Explanation of the results.

The relative deflections of the blades and deflections of the tower(with hub and nacelle combined) are calculated after solving the dynamic mass spring damper system equations for different TI and mean speed time series. 

Blade vs Tower displacements
1. It is observed that deflections for the blades are found to be higher for blades than for tower.
2. This is to due to the higher stiffness of the hub-tower-nacelle system as compared to that of the blades which is relatively softer.

Effect of Wind speed 
1. The displacements increases witht the wind speed and peaks at around 12m/s due to resonance effect. This is due to excitation force being close the natural frequency of the structure.
2. The displacment descreases with higher wind speeds due to increase in damping.

Effect of TI
1. Higher TI causes higher standard deviation in the dispalacement.
2. Higher TI means higher variability of the wind speeds which causes higher vaiability of the displacements.
